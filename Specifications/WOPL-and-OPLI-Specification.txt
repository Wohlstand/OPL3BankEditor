                        1. Single-instrument entry
===============================================================================

    Each instrument file contains a set of data for single
channel of YMF262 chip to setup the timbre

Lenght of each instrument entry is 62 bytes (up to version 2 and in OPLI files)

Any non-ASCII string data must be encoded with UTF-8 and fit to 32 bytes
including the NULL terminator.

Operators in the list below has the next roles:
- Operator 1 - the Carrier1 (Operator 2 for 4-operators mode)
- Operator 2 - the Modulator1 (Operator 1 for 4-operators mode)
- Operator 3 - the Carrier2 (Operator 4 for 4-operators mode)
- Operator 4 - the Modulator2 (Operator 3 for 4-operators mode)

Since version 3, in WOPL banks each instrument has extra 4 bytes for
a two extra fields

                         2. Instrument file (OPLI)
===============================================================================

    Each instrument file contains a set of data for single
channel of YMF262 chip to setup the timbre on it.

Total data lenght: 76 bytes

Bytes-Lenght |  Description
---------------Header--------------------
    11       |  Magic number "WOPL3-INST\0". Where '\0' is a zero byte which
             |  termiates the string

                      3. MIDI playing bank file (WOPL)
===============================================================================

    Bank format designed to store instrument bank for playing MIDI
in multiple standards like GM, GS and XG. Format allows to save
multiple sets with 128-instruments which is needed to store
GS and XG instrument sets which are have more than standard 128
instruments with a single bank.

Any non-ASCII string data must be encoded with UTF-8 and fit to 32 bytes
including the NULL terminator.

Total data length is sum of: 19 + (62*128*MBanks) + (62*128*PBanks) bytes
